This exoplanet orbits around an ultracool dwarf star known as TRAPPIST-1, which lies approximately 40 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. TRAPPIST-1d also resides within the habitable zone around its star.

I relax my plates and slowly the red afternoon lights floods my vision. Squirming on my fatty back side   my front flippers each waggle eight digits. I can hear my parents bellies slithering and flopping as they ready the midday meal.  I turn my attention to the rhythmic grunts  of the knowledge sounds piped in from the central education body.  This year we will begin our visual logical symbolic communication. Although I am already 90 trips around the star my visual ability has only just matured.  I have heard my father scratching with a rod and clicking aurally indistinguishable buttons since I was a blind tadpole. I have only just in the last few years learned that he is communicating without sound.  He grunts to me that his communication is not with other minds like ours.  But a different strange calcified brain of stone.  But he tells me if you speak the right language the stone takes on properties that anyone might consider to be indicative of life.  The language living in the calcified stone becomes changeable and dynamic. He further states that any grunt that has ever been grunted can be coded into the stone. 

I daydream about how wonderful it would be to have one of these stones.  I really have very few possessions several humming shell animals and the flute. But if you ask me I spend all my time with my ear hole jammed up against the central education pipe grunting back and forth the important collected data of our ancestors.  How great it would be to have a quiet brain to communicate with.
